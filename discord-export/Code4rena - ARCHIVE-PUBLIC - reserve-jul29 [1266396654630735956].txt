What is the dark pool


[07/29/2024 20:26] sockdrawermoney
here's a little gist I jammed out about how Dark Horse incentives work https://gist.github.com/sockdrawermoney/ad102b11bca03342944ce7d5f3027739


[07/29/2024 20:27] sockdrawermoney
In terms of how it works for the Reserve Core audit _specifically_, you can find that here https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/958800160870240286/1266836423638782076


[07/29/2024 20:29] tamayonft
The dark pool  is the same as pro league side pool? Which is 30k


[07/29/2024 20:49] sockdrawermoney
Sort of. beat Pro Leaguers and you can win a share of the side pool.


[07/29/2024 20:54] 0xwizard
great counter measure


[07/29/2024 20:55] 0xwizard
it feels fair to try and compete with pro league


[07/29/2024 20:56] tamayonft
Question to the sponsors can we audit this version with any previues knowledge about the past version?


[07/29/2024 20:56] tamayonft
Is this a  big update?


[07/29/2024 21:21] cloudellie (pinned)
Heads up wardens: we've given the Reserve team the go-ahead to merge [this PR](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/1176) that fixes some broken tests, so this will result in a slight tweak to the audit repo. We'll post again once it's been merged.

[07/29/2024 22:29] tbrent
You can check the CHANGELOG out, but in brief it should not be too large an update. The core protocol functionality has remained the same. The main 3 additions have been (i) Registries to support whitelists; (ii) expand decimal support to 21 (with caveats); and (iii) add new "issuance premium" mechanism.


[07/29/2024 22:31] tbrent
Only (iii) is a real change to the economics / accounting of the protocol.


[07/30/2024 00:56] cloudellie (pinned)
Update: this PR has now been merged, and the audit repo `README` has been [updated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/commit/25db7f16a9f5740a602f7a6af0a8714dc2a0203d) accordingly.

Guys any code walkthrough on this?


[07/30/2024 07:29] kriko.eth
Hi:) a quick question - `contracts/p0` is the current version and currently deployed? And `contracts/p1` is the upgrade, correct? üòÑ


[07/30/2024 10:12] mahdi9606
which part of code is unaudited ?


[07/30/2024 12:05] julianmrodri
`p0` is meant to be a "simplified" version of the protocol which was only used for devopment.. .the code in `p1` is the one that's relevant for the audit.


[07/30/2024 12:08] julianmrodri
No part of the code is unaudited. All our deployed code was audited at some point. This is meant to be a fresh new review of our 4.0.0 planned release. there are folders out of scope like "p0" which are not relevant because its not production code.


[07/30/2024 12:27] uaarrr
are there any off chain  mechanisms ?


[07/30/2024 12:32] kriko.eth
Cool, so what version of contracts is currently deployed?


[07/30/2024 12:33] julianmrodri
I dont think so. Can you expand on what type of mechanisms you refer?


[07/30/2024 12:36] julianmrodri
4.0.0 was not deployed yet. If you look at the current version of the protocol running for existing RTokens is 3.4.0 (prior version not the one being audited now)

{Reactions}
üíõ 

[07/30/2024 13:17] uaarrr
i meant back end code that executes certain function(s)


[07/30/2024 13:18] julianmrodri
No,  there are several functions that can be called by anybody to trigger certain events (like auctions, revenue distribution ,etc) but everything happens on chain. There is no backend core process that we keep.


[07/30/2024 13:18] julianmrodri
The audit is full Solidity

[07/30/2024 13:30] tamayonft
hey with that being say its better try this code as a new fresh project


[07/30/2024 13:43] julianmrodri
Not sure I understand, p0 and p1 has nothing to do with if you treat it or not as a fresh project. the code in p0 can be ignored.  The code in P1 is the relevant one


[07/30/2024 14:01] tamayonft
What I mean by that is if the p1 is all what we need to proper understand the project, or i need some aditional part of the anterior version of the project


[07/30/2024 14:08] julianmrodri
Ok I see the confusion. But yes, you can ignore completely p0. It is not a previous version of the project, its more of a prototype version. Just focus on P1


[07/30/2024 14:31] 0xozovehe
Is there anywhere we can see the differences between the last audited version and the current one?


[07/30/2024 15:34] akshatmittal
You can disregard p0, the focus will remain on p1 and that is the one that's fully tested and deployed.

So as far as I understood the protocol has been audited several times and as described on the scope this contest is to review "all" the scope audited before. But the "4.0.0"  PR is not audited? Sorry for the confusion, just wanted to clarify this part.

the contracts in `plugin/trading` are in scope GnosisTrade and DutchTrade


[07/31/2024 15:34] akshatmittal
That's correct. The protocol has been audited several times, and r4.0.0 is the latest iteration. However, for this audit, the ENTIRE protocol is under audit regardless of if it is a new change or an old one. If you don't care about code history, treat the entire codebase as new. The changes PR is only available for additional information, not as an indication of what needs review.

The project is live, there are many RTokens. The protocol is a factory that allows you to create Rtokens.  RSR is just one token shared/used among all RTokens. You can check our UI to get a vibe of the different components: https://app.reserve.org/

Should we treat all contracts in scope as if the project was to be freshly deployed, or take into account that some are live and will be upgraded (so some findings like first donation attacks would be OOS, and we should check for upgrade issues)? Or both?

@Akshat | Reserve struct BasketRange {

bottom means less baskets
top means high baskets?


[08/09/2024 11:37] akshatmittal
See the comment on top of `basketsHeldBy` function.

Basically, `bottom` refers to the _whole_ basket units held, so the minimum or the bottom of what is held. Whereas `top` refers to how many _partial_ baskets can be formed with the available balance, so the max of possible different balances. You'd typically care about `bottom` when considering baskets held by an account or by the protocol.

maybe you have a test with the `only()` keyword, and when you try to run a different test with grep, hardhat ignores it bcs of the only keyword not been applied to the test you want to run?

how do i have to use that? because when i use it on `it` block, it runs every test from other `describe` blocks but only runs the one i marked in that block. applying `only` directly to `describe` block  still runs every test from other `describe` blocks. could you plz tell how to use it properly


[08/12/2024 10:20] aamirusmani1552
does `--grep=""` works for you? I have used hardhat before and it used to work fine. But don't know what is happening now

@Akshat | Reserve is there a limit on the length of the test? I am trying to write one test and it was working fine before. But after adding little bit more code, it gives the message `Killed` and terminates the process. 

Also it looks like in this case, hardhat tries to rerun the test multiple times. Any solution for that?

sorry for this silly question but what is the purpose of the manageTokens function in the revenueTrader?


[08/13/2024 12:58] ililhunterlili
if baskets held > baskets needed in backingManager, we forward the extra collateral to revenueTrader through `forwardrevenue` in backingManager contract

Then we want to open auction Trade on those collateral, or distribute them if they are the `TokenToBuy` , since its no sense to trade the token that we actually want to buy as protocol

Make sense thank so much

ü´° 

[08/13/2024 15:21] akshatmittal
There shouldn't be. You can set test retries to 0 and try again, but we have some massive tests in there. Maybe it's your OS thing because "Killed" is usually not a program limit but an OS limit.

I am using wsl because not able to run a test using cmd. How do i solve it. Do you know a way?

[08/17/2024 08:18] drandkid

[08/17/2024 10:48] tim_peng.
no I didn't. how should I? I did not seem to see the changes to .env mentioned in the repo


[08/17/2024 10:50] aamirusmani1552
check if you have .env.example. Rename it to .env and fill out all the variables and then run the test

@Akshat | Reserve Sorry if this has been asked before, how would you handle a report sent from Immunefi during the contest? If it was reported on Code4rena, would you give OOS on Immunefi or vice versa?


[08/19/2024 11:18] akshatmittal
Issues reported on Immunefi are OOS for this contest, those reports will only be considered on Immunefi. (There's one exception, which is if the issue _specifically_ creates _another_ issue due to the changes made in this version of the code)


[08/19/2024 11:19] eren.eth
Ok thanks :PepeHeart:
